# Components

Components in Dolla come in three forms; Views, Stores and Mixins. All three component types support hooks.

## Views

Views are components that render DOM nodes that the user sees and interacts with.

In React, these are equivalent to components.

## Stores

Stores are components that hold shared state accessible from other components.

In React, these are equivalent to contexts.

## Mixins

Mixins are components that augment the behavior of a DOM node.

React has no equivalent. Mixins are modeled after Angular directives.
