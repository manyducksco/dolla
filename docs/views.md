# Views

Views are one of two component types in Dolla. We call them views because they deal specifically with presenting visible things to the user. The other type of component, [Stores](./stores.md), deal with data and events.

At its most basic, a view is a function that returns markup.

```jsx
function ExampleView() {
  return <h1>Hello World!</h1>;
}
```

## View Props

A view function takes a `props` object as its first argument. This object contains all properties passed to the view when it's invoked.

```jsx
function ListItemView(props) {
  return <li>{props.label}</li>;
}

function ListView() {
  return (
    <ul>
      <ListItemView label="Squirrel" />
      <ListItemView label="Chipmunk" />
      <ListItemView label="Groundhog" />
    </ul>
  );
}
```

As you may have guessed, you can pass States as props and slot them in in exactly the same way. This is important because Views do not re-render the way you might expect from other frameworks. Whatever you pass as props is what the View gets for its entire lifecycle.

## View Helpers

### `cond($condition, whenTruthy, whenFalsy)`

The `cond` helper does conditional rendering. When `$condition` is truthy, the second argument is rendered. When `$condition` is falsy the third argument is rendered. Either case can be left null or undefined if you don't want to render something for that condition.

```jsx
function ConditionalListView(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      {cond(
        props.$show,

        // Visible when truthy
        <ul>
          <ListItemView label="Squirrel" />
          <ListItemView label="Chipmunk" />
          <ListItemView label="Groundhog" />
        </ul>,

        // Visible when falsy
        <span>List is hidden</span>,
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### `repeat($items, keyFn, renderFn)`

The `repeat` helper repeats a render function for each item in a list. The `keyFn` takes an item's value and returns a number, string or Symbol that uniquely identifies that list item. If `$items` changes or gets reordered, all rendered items with matching keys will be reused, those no longer in the list will be removed and those that didn't previously have a matching key are created.

```jsx
function RepeatedListView() {
  const [$items, setItems] = createState(["Squirrel", "Chipmunk", "Groundhog"]);

  return (
    <ul>
      {repeat(
        $items,
        (item, index) => item, // Using the string itself as the key
        ($item, $index, context) => {
          return <ListItemView label={$item} />;
        },
      )}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

### `portal(content, parentNode)`

The `portal` helper displays DOM elements from a view as children of a parent element elsewhere in the document. Portals are typically used to display modals and other content that needs to appear at the top level of a document.

```jsx
function PortalView() {
  const content = (
    <div class="modal">
      <p>This is a modal.</p>
    </div>
  );

  // Content will be appended to `document.body` while this view is connected.
  return portal(document.body, content);
}
```

## View Context

A view function takes a context object as its second argument. The context provides a set of functions you can use to respond to lifecycle events, observe dynamic data, print debug messages and display child elements among other things.

```jsx
function ExampleView(props, ctx) {
  ctx.onMount(() => {
    ctx.log("HELLO!");
  });

  return <h1>Hello World!</h1>;
}
```

### Printing Debug Messages

```jsx
function ExampleView(props, ctx) {
  // Set the name of this view's context. Console messages are prefixed with name.
  ctx.setName("CustomName");

  // Print messages to the console. These are suppressed by default in the app's "production" mode.
  // You can also change which of these are printed and filter messages from certain contexts in the `createApp` options object.
  ctx.info("Verbose debugging info that might be useful to know");
  ctx.log("Standard messages");
  ctx.warn("Something bad might be happening");
  ctx.error("Uh oh!");

  // If you encounter a bad enough situation, you can halt and disconnect the entire app.
  ctx.crash(new Error("BOOM"));

  return <h1>Hello World!</h1>;
}
```

### Lifecycle Events

```jsx
function ExampleView(props, ctx) {
  ctx.beforeMount(() => {
    // Do something before this view's DOM nodes are created.
  });

  ctx.onMount(() => {
    // Do something immediately after this view is connected to the DOM.
  });

  ctx.beforeUnmount(() => {
    // Do something before removing this view from the DOM.
  });

  ctx.onUnmount(() => {
    // Do some cleanup after this view is disconnected from the DOM.
  });

  return <h1>Hello World!</h1>;
}
```

### Displaying Children

The context has an `outlet` function that can be used to display children at a location of your choosing.

```js
function LayoutView(props, ctx) {
  return (
    <div className="layout">
      <div className="content">{ctx.outlet()}</div>
    </div>
  );
}

function ExampleView() {
  // <h1> and <p> are displayed inside LayoutView's outlet.
  return (
    <LayoutView>
      <h1>Hello</h1>
      <p>This is inside the box.</p>
    </LayoutView>
  );
}
```

### Watching States

The `watch` function starts observing when the view is connected and stops when disconnected. This takes care of cleaning up watchers so you don't have to worry about memory leaks.

```jsx
function ExampleView(props, ctx) {
  const [$count, setCount] = createState(0);

  // This callback will run when any states in the dependency array receive new values.
  ctx.watch([$count], (count) => {
    ctx.log("count is now", count);
  });

  // ...
}
```

### Context Variables

> TODO: Write about context state (`.get` and `.set`)

### Context Events

Events can be emitted from views and [stores](./stores.md) using `ctx.emit(eventName, data)`. Context events will bubble up the view tree just like native browser events bubble up the DOM tree.

```js
ctx.on("eventName", (event) => {
  event.type; // "eventName"
  event.detail; // the value that was passed when the event was emitted (or undefined if none)
});

ctx.once("eventName", (event) => {
  // Receive only once and then stop listening.
});

// Remove a listener by reference.
// Listener must be the same exact function that was passed to `on` or `once`.
ctx.off("eventName", listener);

// Emit an event.
ctx.emit("eventName", { value: "This object will be exposed as event.detail" });
```

### Bubbling

Events bubble up through the view tree unless `stopPropagation` is called by a listener. In the following example we have a view listening for events that are emitted from a child of a child.

```js
function ParentView(props, ctx) {
  // Listen for greetings that bubble up.
  ctx.on("greeting", (event) => {
    const { name, message } = event.detail;

    ctx.log(`${name} says "${message}"!`);
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <ChildView />
    </div>
  );
}

function ChildView(props, ctx) {
  ctx.on("greeting", (event, { name, message }) => {
    // Let's perform some censorship.
    // If an event is stopped it not bubble any further and ParentView won't see it.
    if (containsForbiddenKnowledge(message)) {
      event.stop();
    }
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <ChildOfChildView />
    </div>
  );
}

function ChildOfChildView(props, ctx) {
  return (
    <form
      onSubmit={(e) => {
        // This is a browser event handler.
        // Browser events can't be listened for with `this.on`, but we can emit context events from here that can be.
        e.preventDefault();

        // Pluck the values from the form.
        const name = e.currentTarget.name.value;
        const message = e.currentTarget.message.value;

        // Emit!
        ctx.emit("greeting", { name, message });
      }}
    >
      <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Your Name" />
      <input type="text" name="message" placeholder="Your Message" />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```
